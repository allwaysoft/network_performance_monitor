\subsection{Bandwidth measurements}
The system measures the amount of Internet traffic flowing between your modem and router. It uses the number of bits received and transmitted to calculate bandwidth usage in megabits per second (Mbps). The results of these bandwidth measurements are shown on the chart below. Note that the bandwidth values shown are averaged into <BIN_WIDTH> minute intervals during the reporting day, so short bandwidth spikes (e.g. loading an image-heavy web page) are averaged into the <BIN_WIDTH> minute interval during which they occur.
