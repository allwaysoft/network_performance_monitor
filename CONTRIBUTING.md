## Submitting issues
Please keep in mind that the issue tracking system is not a support forum; it is intended for notifying the project team of reproducible issues with the setup and operation of the system, or of issues with documentation.

If you have a USB 3 network adapter that works well with this project (supports Network Namespaces), please submit an issue with the <b>network adapter info</b> label and include the make, model, and (if possible) revision number of the adapter. I will add a list of supported network adapters to the Wiki in the near future.

## Pull requests
<b>Please avoid surprise pull requests.</b>

I welcome contributions to the project, that's how open source projects like this one improve over time. However, your proposed changes should be discussed prior to starting your coding efforts to ensure that they do not impact functionality or usability of the system. You can initiate a conversation by submitting an enhancement issue, or by emailing the repository owner.

When developing a new feature or bug fix for this project, please create a new branch; make your changes in that branch and submit a pull request for that branch. Please do not submit pull requests that contain changes to the master branch.

Thanks,

Chris (mr-canoehead)
